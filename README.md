# vector-fields

![](img/cover-image.png)

It plots vector fields and solutions to the differential equations they represent.. well kinda at least. You can play with it [here](https://julian-q.github.io/vector-fields/) !

You can edit the field it displays by modifying the text boxes in the top left corner and pressing `Enter`. It uses [AsciiMath](http://asciimath.org/) syntax, but there is a LaTeX (via [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)) rendering too so you can make sure you typed everything correctly :D

Also try double clicking and scrolling around. Yay!
