# vector-fields

This is a simple vector field / differential equation plotter I made, ![hosted here](julian-q.github.io/vector-fields)! You can edit the field it displays by modifying the text boxes in the top left corner and pressing `Enter`. It uses ![AsciiMath](http://asciimath.org/) syntax, but there is a LaTeX (via ![MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)) rendering too so you can make sure you typed everything correctly. You can also scroll in and out with the scroll wheel.
